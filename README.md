# SortEX

SortEX provides a fast and efficient way to sort media such as photos and videos into "Year/Month" (YYYY-MM) subfolders corresponding to the files' metadata. Essentially, it does what some older digital cameras or Picasa did in terms of file sorting. 
In the future, I might add more features to the program. Any bugs may be reported via the Issues page.
